# Networking Prototype

A test project for prototyping with [PurrNet](https://github.com/PurrNet/PurrNet).

- Main.unity - main scene;
- Player.cs - basic first person controller and projectile spawning;
- Projectile.cs - counts down and despawns;

To test with multiple clients go to `Window/Multiplayer/Multiplayer Play Mode` and activate virtual players.
